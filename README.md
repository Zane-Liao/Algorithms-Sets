- This experimental repository contains some implementations of my commonly used algorithms and classic teaching algorithms, as well as some data structures.
- This small experimental repository is updated from time to time and will use the latest C++ features (c++11-c++26, Compiler: Apple clang version 17.0.0) to write experimental programs, such as template metaprogramming and generics, some RAII of data structures, compiler optimization and expansion, parallelization and multithreading, etc.
- This repository uses some C++ features intentionally, but is generally based on engineering. That is, we need to ensure both the correctness of the algorithm and its readability. The coding style varies, but generally follows some the Google C++ style.
